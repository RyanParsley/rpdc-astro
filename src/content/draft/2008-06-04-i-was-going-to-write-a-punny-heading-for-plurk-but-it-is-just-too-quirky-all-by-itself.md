So it's not exactly news, <a title="Yet Another Microblog As A Service." href="http://www.plurk.com/" target="_blank">Plurk</a> is on the scene. For the uninitiated, it is yet another microblog site. The big feature they tout is a cool AJAXy dragable timeline to display your updates (plurks) on. As a graphic designer, I really like that the folks at Plurk are carving their niche by focusing on the interface, but as a twitter user, I need attention to ease of post. . However, I'm sure I am far from the first to suggest that a liberal API would help a startup in this market. Furthermore, I would wager this is probably on it's way.

Honestly, I do not see Plurk as a competitor with Twitter. Twitter is really going for being a communication platform where Plurk seems to be more focusing on the community aspect. I do see Plurk as being one to watch in the realm of microblogging in general though. Especially considering I discovered them via Jason Calacanis, the Don King of the the internet.
