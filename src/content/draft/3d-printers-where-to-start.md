## This isn't all that new

I'm sorry to tell you, we're not early adopters on this one. 3D printing has been around since the 80s. The thing that's changed recently is price, which translates to access.

## Nicknacks

While it's true the first thing people tend to print are trinkets, that's far from the limits of these devices. I think it's a good strategy to learning by becoming a decent technician before attempting design. As such, in my first year of owning a 3d printer, I mostly printed models made by others that I knew to be "printable".

- Not a terrible first step
- That is far from the limit of the technology
- How many plastic parts does your car have?

## How does it work?

1. Model
2. Slice
3. ~~Profit~~

   Print

It's a little more complicated than that, but that's a pretty good way to frame it.

## No model, no problem!

## Nothing but a G code

```
G1 X1.2 F25
				Y2.3
				X0.0 F10
				Y0.0
```

## Shapeways

Etsy for 3D printers (also, people sell 3D prints on etsy)

- High Quality Prints
- Materials we can't print
  - Stainless Steel
  - Ceramic
  - Gold
  - etc

This is far from disrupting commerce, but when has it ever been so easy to make custom physical good?

3D printers enable a new avenue for open source hardware.
