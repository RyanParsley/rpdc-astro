It recently occured to me that there are more than a couple similarities between these two unfashionable things. Here is the _long and short_ of it:

1. There is no reasoning with mullet enthusiasts.
2. Both have fishy origins
3. One is an ape drape one is monkey see monkey do.
4. Both seem like a compromise between style and business (see also: business in the frontâ€¦ party in the back), but are really just absurd.
5. At first glance, both concepts seem dated. Under closer evaluation you realize neither was ever a good idea.

Do not make this Achy-Breaky Big Mistakie!
