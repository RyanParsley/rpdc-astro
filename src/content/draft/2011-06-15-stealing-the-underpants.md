<p>A few weeks ago, I decided it was time to start blogging, again. I sat down to my computer, loaded up my blog and realized that I <em>needed</em> to relaunch my blog first. After all, I had rushed this iteration of the blog together in a hurried attempt to match the business cards that I had painstakingly designed. I had never come back to apply the last bit of fit and finish that I told myself I would. My blog was still powered by Drupal 6! Drupal 7 has been out for nearly a year now. How could I possibly sit down to write under such conditions?</p>

<p>Weeks later and Iâ€™m still tinkering with the leading and column counts. I'm still trying to figure out how many layouts I want in my responsive cascade. I'm doing just about everything <strong>but</strong> writing. Today, I put all of those distractions aside, opened a text editor and started mashing away at the keyboard. Finally, I started step one.</p>
