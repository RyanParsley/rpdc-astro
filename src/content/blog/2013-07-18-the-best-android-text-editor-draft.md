Contrary to popular belief, Android users like nice things too. There are a lot of text editors on Android and I spent a bit of time and money trying them all out so you don't have to. I believe [Draft](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mvilla.draft) is the best. It has a beautiful interface with support for Markdown and DropBox. What more could you ask for?

## Runners-up

### Lightpaper
Lightpaper is great for all the reasons listed above, but the interface is a little more complicated than I need. I suspect I'd feel different if I were using it on a tablet.

### Fetchnotes
Interface is gorgous and simple, but there's no way to get your notes out of the app. My text wants to be free. Also, the letterboxed splash screen screams that this app was ported from iOS.
