I&rsquo;ve been talking to more and more people about what apps are good for the Android platform. These are the 10 I use the most. They&rsquo;re in no particular order other than the first one is probably my favorite. If I didn&rsquo;t post your favorite app, drop it in the comments.

## Locale

This is a stellar app that lets you automate tasks on your android phone based on all kinds of contexts. The simplest example is my phone turns itself to silent when I approach the office. A more robust example would be: when I am home, it's after 11pm and my phone is plugged in&hellip; it turns itself to silent. Beyond adjusting the volume (which would be enough) locale can trigger things like: post to twitter, change the brightness, change your wallpaper&hellip;

## BeyondPod

The best podcast aggregator I have tried&hellip; and I have installed many of them. Syncs with Google Reader so you can manage your feeds from any computer also that makes your opml portable so you don't get locked in if you want to try a different aggregator.

## Aldiko

This is an ebook reader that can import any (non-DRM) ebooks you have or download from the thousands of public domain books.

## Twitter

The official twitter app is becoming my favorite twitter app. Even if you prefer another, you should install this one and turn off notifications so that you get the os addons such as listing recent tweets near your contacts.

##Voice
Visual transcriptions of voicemail is a huge boon. It saves so much time (even though it is far from perfect).

##Audible
It's beta, but It's out there. Audible is pretty much the only way to buy audiobooks and now they have an android app! My phone is complete.

## Dropbox

Need I say more?

## AppBrain

Install AppBrain on your phone and it pings a webapp so you can more easily manage your apps from your computer.

## Astrid

The best todo list app I have seen. Simple interface, syncs with Remember The Milk, free and opensource.

##Ringdroid
This is a sound file editing app for creating ringtones right on your phone. Android already lets you use any audio file as a ringtone, but this app lets you cut just the snippet you want for custom ringtones.
