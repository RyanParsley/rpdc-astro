I just stumbled upon some notes I took at FOWA, so this post is less than timely. Better late than never. There was copious amounts of wisdom to gather from this long weekend event, but there was one underlying theme that seemed to be woven into most, if not all, of the presentations. In the spirit of gross generalizations here is a synopsis of the most important theme to have been picked up at FOWA Miami 2008.

We need to embrace the fact that we are not perfect. Instead of striving for perfection, we must simply try to suck less today than we did yesterday. Firmly setting a destination, and never checking our instruments, can easily end up with a perfectly honed path to failure. If we strive to engage our community as participants, more than just users, they will willing guide us to creating the right product (as long as we remain receptive). Focus on progress.
