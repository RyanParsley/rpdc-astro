I was frustrated with the lack of a way to easily make nice tabs quickly for practicing guitar, so I spent a couple of hours thinking about a nice way to mark up chords as html. I decided to share what I came up with so far in this <a href="http://lab.ryanparsley.com/musicMarkup">demo</a>.

Currently, the plan is to write a compass plugin fairly soon to make it easy for anyone to display chords and tabs. I'll share more of the process as I go along. I'd love any feedback you have on my approach.
