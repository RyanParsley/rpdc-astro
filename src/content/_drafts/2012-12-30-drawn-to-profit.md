I’ve been doing more self motivated illustrations lately and decided to submit some as stock images. I figured that since I have a bit of inventory, I should put it to work for me. I definitely underestimated the amount of work that goes into creating stock illustrations.

I was a bit tempted to just set up a commerce site of my own, but quickly thought better of it. I want to sell images, not create and maintain a platform to do so. Additionally, I want to be a part of a community that I can learn from. After looking around a little, I decided to try [GraphicRiver](http://graphicriver.net/?ref=RyanParsley). I like their generous revenue split and the fact that they seem more focused on illustrations. Some of the other stock sites seem to be primarily focused on photography with Illustrations a distant second.

It was surprisingly hard to post my first image. I have come to find out that the complex process is not entirely unique to [GraphicRiver](http://graphicriver.net/?ref=RyanParsley). Most stock image marketplaces work have some sort of test you must complete to prove that you actually read the submission guidelines. After failing the test the first time, the idea of creating my own marketplace started sounding good again. I, eventually, swallowed my pride and passed the test. It was a bit frustrating, but I understand why this kind of thing is important.

I know my way around Illustrator, but there is a bit of a gap between creating assets for yourself and creating assets to sell in a marketplace. I think of myself as rather tidy with layer organization, titling and other anal retentive best practices. Fastidious tendencies didn't completely negate pitfalls of comparing my work to someone else's checklist. One tricky requirement is, you can’t submit your work as an Illustrator file (as if there’s any other vector software out there). This means that not all of the cool illustrator effects you may be counting on are at your disposal. You have to carefully expand any appearances and effects in ways that are compatible with a really old version of EPS. Fortunately, the first image I chose to upload didn't make use of anything too hard to translate. I'll definitely need to keep this in mind for future projects.

After a few rounds of technical revisions, [my first illustration](http://graphicriver.net/item/lady-guitarist/3673345?ref=RyanParsley) has been successfully submitted. I look forward to getting more illustrations up soon. It’s certainly not an effortless way to make money. But, what is? I’m sure I’ll share more of the process here as I go along.
