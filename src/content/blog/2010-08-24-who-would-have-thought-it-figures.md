While it’s not shocking *that* [someone snatched up the talent of 280 North](http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/24/motorola-snaps-up-280-north-for-20-million/), *who* aquired them (more to the point why) brings a smile to my face that can only be conjured up by sweet… sweet irony. Motorola (the hardware company) has aquired a startup “dedicated to advancing the state of the art on the web.”

[280 North](http://280north.com/) is probably most notable for creating [Cappuccino](http://cappuccino.org/), “an open source framework that makes it easy to build desktop-caliber applications that run in a web browser.” The framework and team are quite impressive, but why would a phone manufacturer care? According to a Motorola spokesperson states, “We believe 280 North will be instrumental in helping us continue to foster the Android ecosystem with innovative web-based technologies and applications.”

280 North is a team that so whole heartedly loves the way Apple products come together, they [reimplemented Cocoa and Objective-C in JavaScript](http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2008/06/cocoa-on-the-web-280-north-objective-j-and-cappuccino.ars). Motorola has recruited a brilliant, Apple-enthusiast, team for the betterment of Android. I wonder if they’ll be trading in their iPhones for Droids.
