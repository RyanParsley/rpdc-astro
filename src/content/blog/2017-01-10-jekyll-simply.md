I was talking with a coworker about my recent jekyll reboot. He had a handful of questions that lead me to believe that the official documentation may be a bit overwhelming to someone new to Jekyll. There are many ways you can configure Jekyll and many ways to cultivate a rich content strategy on top of it. What isn't imediately obvious is: what's the least I need to do to benefit from Jekyll.

To help illustrate that point, I put together a quick repo ([source](https://github.com/RyanParsley/MVJekyll), [demo](https://ryanparsley.github.io/MVJekyll)) minimally configured to get a site built for github pages. This project is complete with default configuration overrides, nested layouts and Sass compliation. And, not much else. Hopefully, this slimmed down example project will help you see the benefits of Jekyll without getting too overwhelmed with the embarassment of features that you likely don't need on day 1.
