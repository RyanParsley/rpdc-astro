I make a lot of websites with Drupal. Since I do this a lot, I've been spending time working on a way to speed up and/or automate the process as much as possible. This <strike>distraction</strike> project had the fortunate byproduct of the following list.

This is a list of modules that tend to make it into every Drupal project I build these days. These modules are mostly about extending Drupal as a CMS, so they'll enhance just about any kind of site. They are the modules that will make your admin users happy and likely reduce the support calls you get (making you happy).

1. [Markdown Filter](http://drupal.org/project/markdown) - Markdown is a great compromise between WYSIWTF editors and expecting users to learn HTML. It's also faster to write even if you do know HTML.
2. [Typogrify](http://drupal.org/project/typogrify) - It's unreasonable to ask mortals to type the necessary html to create proper quotes.
3. [CCK Blocks](http://drupal.org/project/cck_blocks) - Hide fields from the body of the content and display them in a block someplace. This is a great tool for making more interesting layouts to showcase custom content types.
4. [Menu Block](http://drupal.org/project/menu_block) - It does more, but I mostly use this to create separate navigation elements that are bound to one trail of links.
5. [Block Class](http://drupal.org/project/block_class) - Add arbitrary classes to blocks.
6. [Block Title Link](http://drupal.org/project/block_titlelink) - Handy for linking a list of teasers to a view
7. [Webform](http://drupal.org/project/webform) - I like this better than the core contact form because it saves all entries to the database.
8. [Scheduler](http://drupal.org/project/scheduler) - Create an unpublished node and cron will publish later.
9. [Menu Trail By Path](http://drupal.org/project/menu_trail_by_path) - Usually does exactly what I need for keeping the menu path preserved.
10. [Backup and Migrate](http://drupal.org/project/backup_migrate) - Let the robots back up your content. This module not only makes backups, but also prunes your backups on a schedule you set.

I made a point to not list any of the top 10 most downloaded modules, because I figure those are easy enough to find on your own. [Let me know](/contact) if you find this useful.
