Up until recently, I've been reluctant to do much sketching digitally. This month, I found the perfect excuse to explore a purely digital process. I’m currently taking part in an event called [30 Characters in 30 Days](http://www.30characters.com/author/ryanparsley/). There’s not much more to the challenge than the title suggests. Participants are simply tasked with creating 30 unique characters in the month of November.

I decided to make things a bit more interesting by using many different illustration styles and even new tools that I’m not familiar with during this challenge. It’s been a great excuse to spend more quality time with my iPad. I thought I’d take a moment to share my thoughts on a few of the new tools I’ve added to my arsenal.

## Painting & Sketching

I’ve spent a bit of time sketching in [SketchBook](http://bit.ly/sketchbookApp) and it’s great. It’s arguably the most popular painting app out there. I like this app a lot, but have read good things about a competitor. I decided to give [procreate](http://bit.ly/procreateApp) a go. I think I like it more. The interface for procreate is more opinionated that Sketchbook, which I mostly (eventually) agree with. Having quick access between brush, smudge, and erase is excellent for getting ideas down quickly. I do wish the space used for undo and redo could be reassigned to color toggling since undo and redo have gestures. For quick value studies, I found the placement of the brush size and opacity sliders perfect. So far, I’ve completed 4 illustrations with procreate and sketched out 2 others to be completed in other apps.

## Vector

I would suspect if someone wasn’t already familiar with Illustrator, they’d not miss it if they had [Inkpad](http://bit.ly/inkpadApp). As an Illustrator user, I found a few uncanny valley issues frustrating, but I mostly enjoyed the process. Some actions (like grouping) felt laborious since they required navigating a menu (can this be mitigated with gestures?). I was definitely less productive on the iPad that I would have been with Illustrator on a computer with a mouse and keyboard. Most importantly, I did like the results. I’ve only completed 1 illustration with Inkpad, but there’s still 11 days to go.

## Pixel Art

For crafting pixel art, I have found the app [Sprite Something](http://bit.ly/spriteSomething) delightful to work with. It makes pixel art far more fun. It is a bit frustrating to not have layers for positioning elements, but that just leads to a bit more thoughtfulness in the initial mark creation. I’ve already made 6 pixel character illustrations and have cut myself off from making more for the competition. I do however plan to spend much more quality time with this app in the future.

I do still tend to prefer sketching on [paper](http://bit.ly/deadTree) rather than [Paper](http://bit.ly/paperApp), but there is a lot to be said for introducing digital tools to your workflow. I’m really warming up to the iPad as a content creation device. Now, I need to get my hands on a pressure sensitive stylus.
