<p>Here are the steps I take to efficiently sketch out grids in Illustrator. The best part is: step 6 can be revisited at any time and modified, should you change your mind or want to experiment further. This kind of flexibility is quickly winning me over to Illustrator for&nbsp;wireframing.</p>
<ol class="long">
<li>Create a 1024px X 768px document </li>
<li>Select the Rectangle Tool&nbsp;(M)</li>
<li>Click once anywhere on the&nbsp;canvas</li>
<li>In the Rectangle Tool Dialog, enter 960px X 768px</li>
<li>Use the Align Pallet to center the rectangle with respect to the&nbsp;Artboard</li>
<li><code>Menu > Object > Path > Split Into Grid</code>
</li>
<li>Enter whatever numbers you like. Illustrator will attempt to adjust other numbers to help you out.

<li>Now, you should have a group of paths and a bunch of paths outside of that group. Rename the group &#8220;Guides&#8221;</li>
<li>Select the paths not in the &#8220;Guides&#8221; group and group them</li>
<li>Rename the new group &#8220;Boxes&#8221;</li>
<li>Hide the Boxes Group. You don&#8217;t need these anymore, but if you change your mind about the grid, you can select all of them and go back to step 6. How awesome is that!?</li>
<li>The &#8220;Guides&#8221; group currently contains a bunch of paths with no strokes. To make them actual guides, select them all and <code>Menu > View > Guides > Make Guides</code></li>
<li>Rename that layer &#8220;Horizontal Grid&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#8217;s all there is to it. It looks like a lot of steps, but you get really fast at it. I like using the &#8220;Split Into Grid&#8221; dialog to find my grid when I&#8217;m still working out how wide I want my gutters to be. I find it to be an invaluable tool.</p>
